#COL 362/632 Database Design Course, Spring 2024

#Designed and implemented a comprehensive relational database for course administration using PostgreSQL 15.x and PLPGSQL. Created schemas for critical tables including student, courses, professor, and department, ensuring data integrity through constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK. Developed advanced triggers and functions to enforce business rules, such as validating student IDs, updating sequence numbers, and logging department changes while restricting students to one department change. Implemented automated triggers to maintain consistency across tables, such as updating total credits upon course enrollment and preventing over-enrollment. Built views like course_eval and student_semester_summary to facilitate real-time insights into course performance and student grades. Ensured database performance and reliability by adhering to strict schema design principles and employing rigorous testing against a set of predefined use cases. Successfully created a robust, scalable database solution that met all specified requirements and passed automatic evaluations.
